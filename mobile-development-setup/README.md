## Objective
The goal of this task is to set up a mobile development testing environment using Expo Go. Expo Go allows developers to test React Native applications directly on a physical device without the need for heavy emulators.

## Tools and Requirements
The following tools were required for this setup:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows Operating System
- Expo Go mobile application
- Android mobile device

## Expo Go Installation Process

1. I visited the official Expo Go website at https://expo.dev/go.
2. I selected the latest SDK version.
3. I installed Expo Go from the Google Play Store on my Android device.
4. After installation, I opened the Expo Go app.
5. I created an Expo account and logged in successfully.

## Challenges Faced
During the setup process, I did not encounter any major challenges. The installation was straightforward, and the app worked as expected after logging in.

## Conclusion
Expo Go provides an efficient and cost-effective way to test mobile applications directly on a physical device. This setup will be used for subsequent React Native development tasks.
